You go to the book store. It's a huge sprawling store with books on every surface, up to the ceiling. Maze-like, full of dark corners and narrow passageways.

The old man who runs the shop: well dressed, speaks slowly. Says he needs to go get the book in the back, feel free to browse around while he gets it.

You look around and see you're standing near several labelled sections...

GO TO
* [COMIC BOOKS](6)
* [HISTORY](7)
* [CHECK THE CARD CATALOG](7a)
* [WHAT'S IN THAT ROOM LABELLED "DO NOT ENTER"?](8)
