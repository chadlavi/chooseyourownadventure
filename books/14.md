You go to pull another book from the stack, but it feels pretty stuck. You pull and you pull... and when the book comes loose, you tumble across the room and crash into the wall of books, which promptly avalanches down over you!

Dozens of books rain down on you, and as you scramble away you see that now a whole section of the wall is cleared of books. Books are falling down from the ceiling where the stacks used to be, at a regular rate of about one per second, seeming to appear out of thin air... and instead of actual walls, you see that this room seems to have walls made entirely of books.

Beyond the opened up section of book-wall, you see there is a dark hallway running from left to right in front of you, with damp, dark stone walls and sputtering torches.
