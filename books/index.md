# The Bookshop

You're 14, it's July. You live in Queens, NY. Your mom sends you to run some errands:
* go to the book store and pick up the book she ordered
* go to the grocery store and get
  * garlic
  * eggs
  * italian sausage
* pick up the dry cleaning

You grab your backpack and head out.

What do you do first?
* [BOOK STORE](2)
* [DRY CLEANING](3)
